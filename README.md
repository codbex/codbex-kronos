## Description

Compatible environment for [SAP HANA Extended Application Services](https://help.sap.com/viewer/52715f71adba4aaeb480d946c742d1f6/2.0.03/en-US/a6c0749255d84a81a154a7fc87dd33ce.html) (XS) based applications. It is deployed outside of [SAP HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html?btp=991d50bf-fa15-4979-ac4b-b280b0eb951f) instance as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) a container on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Hence, some of the features can work against any other JDBC compliant RDBMS such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). The compatibility stack is an extension of the [Eclipse Dirigible](https://github.com/eclipse/dirigible) cloud development platform.

### Background

In the SAP Cloud Platform Neo environment XS classic programming model (XSC) is supported via the HANA 1.x database. The XSC engine resides in the HANA system itself. It can scale up, but cannot scale out. It is based on the multi-threaded JavaScript runtime Mozilla Spydermonkey (Firefox's engine). It supports synchronous programming model. It can serve backend services in JavaScript, HTML5 and other static content. It supports OData v2.0 compatible services defined in an \*.xsodata descriptors. It supports automatic tables, views, calculationviews materialisation based on proprietary formats.

Kronos approach is to provide a custom [Eclipse Dirigible](https://www.dirigible.io/) stack coming with XSC engine type. This engine is based on the standard Dirigible's JavaScript engine with several enhancements such as predefined XSC API pre-loaded ($.* APIs), execution based on \*.xsjs instead of \*.js only, imports based on \*.xsjslib instead of \*.js.

There are corresponding APIs in Dirigible playing the same role as the ones in XSC (e.g. request, response, connection, etc.). A thin XSC bridge is provided for full compatibility.

The programming model is synchronous in multi-threaded environment (based on [GraalJS](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs)). The descriptors for the table, views and calculationviews currently exists with the same life-cycle management, only the format is different. OData via descriptor approach is also available as part of the stack as well.

Kronos stack is based on Java (JVM), so all the available plugins and/or new frameworks from Apache, Eclipse, and other open source providers can be easily integrated as well.

Kronos stack can run within the HANA box, also in the virtual HANA system or outside in e.g. Kubernetes cluster, Kyma, Cloud Foundry, Open Stack.

## FAQ

- How long will Kronos be supported?

  > Kronos is an open source project with community support. Everyone can join and make a [PR](CONTRIBUTING.md). In fact SAP discontinued official support to project "XSK", and this fork maintained by the same developers is prove that the approach is viable and useful. The company codbex provide enterprise support for Kronos based runtimes.

- Should future developments be based on Kronos?

  > Yes, you can use Kronos for future development.

- What about the tooling? Do we get state of the art tooling for maintaining and enhancing Kronos?

  > Kronos tooling is based on [Eclipse Dirigible](https://www.dirigible.io/) and in the near future it will be possible to maintain Kronos projects with any modern IDE like VSCode, Eclipse Theia, etc.

- What about the ops aspects - will Kronos be smoothly integrated into a state-of-the-art lifecycle and ops management (be it SAP-based or non-SAP based like GitHub Actions?

  > Yes, the Kronos itself uses [GitHub actions](https://github.com/codbex/codbex-kronos/actions) for CI/CD

- Will there be limitations that will not be mitigated?
